# Clarified MXD

This script will create and populate a file gdb with all the unique data sources used in an mxd. Ideal for when you need to move an mxd with a lot of sde sources to a closed system.

### Directions
1. Open the command line terminal.

2. Change Directory and run the python script
```
cd project_directory
C:\Python27\ArcGIS10.8\python.exe clarified_mxd.py
```
3. You will be prompted to provide the full directory for your mxd. Just drag and drop the file into the command line window and click enter.

4. You will also be prompted to provide a name for the gdb where all the sources are being outputed to.

5. After the scripted has run you will have the file gdb and a zipped version.
